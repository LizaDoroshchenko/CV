## TodoMVC testing

After solving a few small tasks, I decided to write real [automated tests]() for
site [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/#/) testing its core functionality.

#### List of checks:

1. Entering characters in the input field and checking the creation of the item;
2. Checking the impossibility of creating an empty item;
3. Checking the possibility of complete one item;
4. Checking the possibility of complete all items;
5. Checking the possibility to delete one item;
6. Checking the possibility of deleting all completed items;
7. Checking the view of all active items;
8. Checking the view of all completed items;

All checks are carried out in the Google Chrome browser.
