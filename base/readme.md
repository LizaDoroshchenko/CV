## Converter, Calculator, Go to school

Studying the theoretical material, I performed several practical tasks,

#### namely:

1. [Converter]() that handles 3 types of currencies, and several [tests]() that check the functions of the converter.
2. [Calculator]() which takes 2 numbers and adds them up. There are also a couple of simple [checks]() for the calculator.
3. A [Go to school]() task whose conditions are: You need to create a class with a method to help
   you decide whether to go to school. if the temperature is < -25 ℃, we don't go to school at all if the temperature is
   -25 ..- 20 ℃, you can go if the path is < 1 km. To check this task, several [tests]() are also written.
