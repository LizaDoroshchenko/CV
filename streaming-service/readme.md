# Streaming Service
## 1. Intro

I performed this task based on my experience in testing and using web services. To improve the quality of test scenarios
and better understand the requirements, I created  [UI prototypes](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/tree/main/streaming-service/ui-prototype-design) of the future product.

To create test cases, I used such test design techniques as equivalent partitioning, boundary value analysis, 
[decision table](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/blob/main/streaming-service/Decision%20Table%20Block%202.%20User%20profile.pdf).

## 2. Assignment

The customer came to the company with the idea of repeating the success of the famous streaming service and trying to 
create something similar for their local market.  You need to prepare for testing in advance by creating a suite of test
cases to cover all the functionalities.

The founder provided a [working diagram](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/blob/main/streaming-service/workflow-diagram.png) and a [scheme with logic](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/blob/main/streaming-service/Business%20logic%20scheme%20(streaming%20service).pdf) for each block. Itâ€™s the only documentation you have. 
Unfortunately, there is no Business Analyst on the project, and the founder is not ready to give detailed clarifications 
and answers to the questions. You need to design test scenarios based on your own experience 
and understanding of the system.
