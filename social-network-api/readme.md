### 1. Social Network API

After studying API Testing, I completed a practical task [Social Network API](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/tree/main/social-network-api), by creating my collection of tests in Postman. Using documentation ["SamuraiJS Social Network API"](https://social-network.samuraijs.com/docs#) I have tested several functions:

1. View information about users (search for a user by name or id, search for multiple users, check specific pages);
2. Registration in a social network;
3. View personal information;
4. Deleting my account;
