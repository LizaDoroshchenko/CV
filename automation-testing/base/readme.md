## Converter, Calculator, Go to school

Studying the theoretical material, I performed several [practical tasks](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/tree/main/automation-testing/base),

#### namely:

1. [Converter](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/tree/main/automation-testing/base/src/main/java/org/converter) that handles 3 types of currencies, and several [tests](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/tree/main/automation-testing/base/src/test/java/converter) that check the functions of the converter.
2. [Calculator](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/tree/main/automation-testing/base/src/main/java/org/calculator) which takes 2 numbers and adds them up. There are also a couple of simple [checks](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/tree/main/automation-testing/base/src/test/java/calculator) for the calculator.
3. A [Go to school](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/tree/main/automation-testing/base/src/main/java/org/gotoschool) task whose conditions are: You need to create a class with a method to help
   you decide whether to go to school. if the temperature is < -25 ℃, we don't go to school at all if the temperature is
   -25 ..- 20 ℃, you can go if the path is < 1 km. To check this task, several [tests](https://github.com/LizaDoroshchenko/CV/tree/main/automation-testing/base/src/test/java/weathertest) are also written.
